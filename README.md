# Telco Customer Churn Analysis â€“ SQL & Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyses **Telco customer churn data** to identify key drivers of churn and recommend actionable strategies to improve retention rates.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL Workbench:** Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- **Power BI Desktop:** Data modelling, DAX measures, interactive dashboard creation

---

## Data Preparation in MySQL Workbench

### Key SQL Queries:

- **Remove missing TotalCharges values:**
  ```sql
  UPDATE telcodata SET TotalCharges = NULL WHERE TRIM(TotalCharges) = '';

  CASE WHEN SeniorCitizen = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS SeniorCitizenCategory

  CASE
  WHEN tenure BETWEEN 0 AND 12 THEN '0-12 months'
  WHEN tenure BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN '13-24 months'
  WHEN tenure BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN '25-36 months'
  WHEN tenure BETWEEN 37 AND 48 THEN '37-48 months'
  WHEN tenure BETWEEN 49 AND 60 THEN '49-60 months'
  ELSE '60+ months'
END AS tenure_group


### Power BI Data Analysis & Visualisation 

#### Key DAX Measures:

**Total Customers** = COUNTROWS(telcodata_cleaned)

**Total Churned** = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(telcodata_cleaned), telcodata_cleaned[Churn] = "Yes")

**Churn Rate %** = DIVIDE([Total Churned], [Total Customers], 0)

**Average Monthly Charges** = AVERAGE(telcodata_cleaned[MonthlyCharges])

**Total Monthly Revenue** = SUM(telcodata_cleaned[MonthlyCharges])


### Key Dashboard Visuals:

KPI Cards: Total Customers, Total Churned, Churn Rate %, Average Monthly Charges, Total Monthly Revenue

Bar Chart: Customer Count by Contract Type

Column Chart: Customer Count by Tenure Group

Stacked Bar Chart: Customer Churn by Gender

Donut Chart: Gender Distribution

Line Chart: Average Monthly Charges by Tenure Group

Slicers: Gender, Contract Type, Payment Method, Senior Citizen, Internet Service Type

### Business Insights & Recommendations

**Problem** : High churn (~19.2%) affecting revenue stability.

**Findings**:

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn.

Customers with 0-12 months tenure show greater churn risk.

Gender distribution is balanced, suggesting focus on contract strategies and tenure-based campaigns rather than gender.

**Recommendations:**

Promote annual/two-year contracts with loyalty discounts.

Implement targeted onboarding and retention campaigns for first-year customers.

Enhance billing/payment experiences for better customer satisfaction.
